# Matter Kit
A base WordPress theme.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-matter-kit using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-matter-kit
```

Then you can call the subgenerators!

```bash
yo matter-kit:install-core
yo matter-kit:install-theme
yo matter-kit:install-styleguide
yo matter-kit:install-components
yo matter-kit:create-component
```

## Setting up with Chassis
Firstly, cd to where your projects will be set up. We'll create a new directory for this project - change the variables to match your needs.
```bash
PROJECT="MyProject"
CODE="proj"
THEME="theme-name"
AUTHOREMAIL="helpdesk@mattersolutions.com.au"
AUTHORURL="https://www.mattersolutions.com.au"
mkdir "$PROJECT"
cd "$PROJECT"
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Chassis/Chassis
cd Chassis
yo matter-kit:setup
```
Fill out the prompts from the matter-kit:setup generator, which builds the local config file for Chassis. We've opted to use the WordPress default content folder names to better align with the usual live environments we face.
```bash
mkdir wp-content
cd wp-content
mkdir themes
mkdir plugins
cd themes
mkdir "$THEME"
cd "$THEME"
yo matter-kit:install-core
yo matter-kit:install-theme
```
Fill out the prompts for the theme installation.
```bash
git init
git add -A .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
yo matter-kit:install-styleguide
```
Fill out the prompts for the styleguide, choosing colours, the primary typeface and primary typeface sizing.
```bash
vagrant up --provision
vagrant ssh
wp site empty
```
Empty the WP installation of it's dummy data.
```bash
wp theme activate theme-name
wp user create mttr-test helpdesk@mattersolutions.com.au --role=administrator
wp user delete 1 --reassign=2
```
Note the password for the user so you can log in. 
```bash

exit
yo matter-kit:install-components
```
Choose the components you wish to install. Several are checked by default, because they're commonly used across all installs.

**Note** that this installation process doesn't install Advanced Custom Fields Pro, which is a necessary WordPress plugin for using the Matter Kit theme base. We also recommend installing Gravity Forms, however the installation will work without that. 
```bash
npm install
```
Run the install to download the frontend dependencies and get the build process going.
